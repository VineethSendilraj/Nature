          <p>The aquatic biome includes the habitats around the world that are dominated by water—from tropical reefs to brackish mangroves, to Arctic lakes. The aquatic biome is the largest of all the world's biomes—it occupies about 75 percent of the Earth's surface area. The aquatic biome provides a vast array of habitats that, in turn, support a staggering diversity of species.Aquatic habitats are three-dimensional environments that can be divided into distinct zones based on characteristics such as depth, tidal flow, temperature, and proximity to landmasses. Additionally, aquatic biomes can be divided into two main groups based on the salinity of their water—these include freshwater habitats and marine habitats.</p></div>

            <p>Aquatic animals are defined by animals living in the water or the aquatic biome. Types of aquatic animals include marine mammals such as whales, dolphins, sea lions, seals, manatees and walruses. Other types are fish, including bony fish such as groupers and cartilaginous fish such as sharks and rays. Invertebrate aquatic animals include sponges, corals, sea stars, sea anemones, sea urchins and sea cucumbers. Other examples include sand dollars, jellyfish and colony animals such as the Portuguese man-of-war, marine worms, clams, mussels and barnacles.</p></center><br>

            <p>Aquatic plants are plants that have adapted to living in aquatic environments (saltwater or freshwater). They are also referred to as hydrophytes or macrophytes to distinguish them from algae and other microphytes. A macrophyte is a plant that grows in or near water and is either emergent, submergent, or floating. In lakes and rivers macrophytes provide cover for fish, substrate for aquatic invertebrates, produce oxygen, and act as food for some fish and wildlife. Some examples of aquatic plants are coral, seaweed, etc.</p></center><br>
